name: Titanium.App.iOS.UserActivity
summary: The UserActivity module is used to enable device Handoff and to create User Activities.
description: |
    A UserActivity object requires the `activityType` property to be specified at creation time.
    Additional properties can be set either at creation or set individually after creation.

    Handoff will not work in the simulator.  You must build and run on a compatible device.

    Handoff functionality depends on a few things:

      * You must be logged into the same iCloud account on each device you wish to use Handoff.
      * Handoff broadcasts activities via Bluetooth LE signals, so both the broadcasting and receiving devices must have Bluetooth LE 4.0 support.
      * Connect all devices to the same Wi-Fi network.

    Make sure you have two Handoff compatible devices running iOS 8 or later that are logged onto the same iCloud account.

  - name: activityType
    summary: Name of the activity type.
    description: |
        Apple recommends using a reverse DNS scheme to name activities in the format: com.<company>.<application>.<activity_type>.

        The activity type must also be registered in the `ios plist` section of the `tiapp.xml` file.  Add the `NSUserActivityTypes`
        key and set its value to an array of activity type strings.

  - title: Creating a new UserActivity Example
    example: |
        The following example demonstrates how to create a new UserActivity and mark the activity as
        the current activity Handoff should be using when switching between devices.

        It is important to note that all activityTypes must be defined in your `tiapp.xml` before this
        feature can be supported.  It is important to check the supported property on your UserActivity
        to ensure the activity created is supported on your device.

        #### app.js

            var activity =  Ti.App.iOS.createUserActivity({
            activityType: 'com.setdirection.home',
                title: 'activity 1',
                userInfo: {
                    msg: 'hello world'
                }
            });

            if(!activity.isSupported()){
                alert('User Activities are not supported on this device!');
            } else {
                activity.becomeCurrent();

                Ti.App.iOS.addEventListener('continueactivity', function(e) {
                    if (e.activityType === 'com.setdirection.home' && e.userInfo.msg) {
                        alert(e.userInfo.msg);
                    }
                });
            }
