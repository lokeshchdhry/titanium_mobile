Thank you for the interest in contributing. We'd like to review and possibly merge as soon as possible. For this to happen, please make sure the following is in order:

- [ ] Sign the [CLA](https://cla.appcelerator.com) for open source contributions (only required for your first contribution)
- [ ] Follow the instructions stated in [Contributing to Titanium](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Contributing+to+Titanium), including the request to squash commits, include unit tests and use clear commit titles (this will be your legacy!)
- [ ] If you are fixing an issue that already has a [JIRA ticket](https://jira.appcelerator.org), include the URL in your PR description
- [ ] If you are fixing an issue that has no JIRA ticket, yet, create a [new ticket](https://jira.appcelerator.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) and include the URL in your PR description
- [ ] Use a clear title.
- [ ] Prefix the  PR title with the JIRA ticket number (`[ABC-123] My clear title`)

That's it, you are good to go! If you have any further questions or problems, feel free to ask us on [TiSlack](https://tislack.org).
