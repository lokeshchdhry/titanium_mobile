Welcome to the Titanium open source project.  Titanium provides
a platform for web developers to build cross-platform, native mobile applications
using JavaScript.

Currently, Titanium supports mobile smartphone operating systems such as Apple iPhone, Google's Android, and Mobile Web. Other platforms, such as Windows Phone, are currently in development.

Alloy
-----

[Alloy](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_Quick_Start) is the MVC application framework built on top of Titanium.  It is optional. It rocks. Check it out if you're considering using Titanium. It is also a separate [open source project](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy) available under Apache Public License.

Contributing
------------

Titanium is an open source project.  Titanium wouldn't be where it is now without contributions by the community. Please consider forking Titanium to improve, enhance or fix issues. If you feel like the community will benefit from your fork, please open a pull request.

To protect the interests of the Titanium contributors, Appcelerator, customers and end users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is simple and straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any Appcelerator open source project are properly licensed and that you have the legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes only a few minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

[You can digitally sign the CLA](http://cla.appcelerator.com) online. Please indicate your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.


Building Locally
----------------

Previously Titanium used scons and python scripts to build the SDK.
If you'd like to build the SDK locally, we've replaced scons with some Node.JS scripts. Typical usage would be:

	cd build
	npm install
	node scons.js build --android-ndk /opt/android-ndk --android-sdk /opt/android-sdk
	node scons.js package
	node scons.js install

The build and package commands will default to all target platforms on your host OS unless explicitly specified. (i.e. Android, iOS, and Mobileweb on OS X; Windows, Android and MobileWeb on Windows)

The build command will look for Android NDK and SDK using $ANDROID_NDK and $ANDROID_SDK env variables if not explicitly passed using command line arguments.

You can use the `-h` flag to display the full list of comands and options.

	cd build
	npm install
	node scons.js build [platform1] [platform2] --android-ndk /opt/android-ndk --android-sdk /opt/android-sdk /Users/build/android-sdk-macosx
	node scons.js package [platform1] [platform2]
	node scons.js install
